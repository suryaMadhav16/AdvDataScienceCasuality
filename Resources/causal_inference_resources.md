Handoff Message for Next Chat
We've completed a comprehensive Jupyter notebook implementation covering:

Introduction to causal inference
The IHDP dataset
Causal inference framework
Implementation of various causal inference methods

The next sections to be developed are:

Part 5: Results and Comparative Analysis
Part 6: From Analysis to Decision-Making
Part 7: Conclusion and Future Directions

The new chat should focus on implementing these remaining sections, with emphasis on:

Evaluating methods using appropriate metrics
Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects
Translating results to practical insights
Discussing limitations and future research directions

All code and data preparation has been completed in previous sections, so the remaining work focuses on analysis, interpretation, and application of the results.
