- [ ] Upload the .ipynb file to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/nikbearbrown/INFO_7390_Art_and_Science_of_Data/tree/main/Causal_Inference/Spring_2024

## Assignment 3: Quiz Questions (25 points)
This assignment creates assessment materials to test understanding of causality concepts.

### Deliverables:
- [ ] **15 Multiple Choice Questions** with:
  - [ ] Multiple options as correct answers for each question
  - [ ] Detailed explanations for why each option is correct or incorrect

### Submission Requirements:
- [ ] Upload to Canvas

## General Requirements
- [ ] All assignments due Tuesday by 11:59pm
- [ ] These are individual assignments to be completed independently
- [ ] Ensure consistency across all three assignments

## Assignment Analysis and Explanation

### What is Causality?
Causality refers to the relationship between cause and effect. In data science, causal inference explores how variables influence each other beyond simple correlation, which is crucial for making accurate predictions and informed decisions.

### Assignment 1: Written Section
This is the primary assignment requiring you to create an educational Jupyter Notebook on some aspect of causality. You need to:

1. Choose a specific topic within causality (e.g., causal discovery algorithms, counterfactual analysis, instrumental variables, etc.)
2. Create a well-structured notebook explaining both the theory and practical applications
3. Include working Python code examples to demonstrate the concepts
4. Record a video explaining your notebook content

The notebook should be comprehensive enough to teach someone unfamiliar with the topic, while the video should concisely explain the key points.

### Assignment 2: Worked Examples
This assignment complements Assignment 1 by providing hands-on examples using real datasets:

1. Create practical demonstrations applying the causality concepts from your main notebook
2. Use two different datasets to show how the concepts work in different contexts
3. Ensure the examples are detailed with step-by-step explanations and code

### Assignment 3: Quiz Questions
This assignment tests understanding of the concepts covered:

1. Create questions that assess comprehension of both theoretical and practical aspects
2. Include questions of varying difficulty levels
3. Provide detailed explanations for all options to reinforce learning

## Suggested Approach
1. First, select a specific aspect of causality that interests you
2. Research the topic thoroughly using academic and practical resources
3. Develop the main notebook (Assignment 1) with clear explanations and code
4. Create the worked examples (Assignment 2) using appropriate datasets
5. Formulate quiz questions (Assignment 3) covering key concepts
6. Record your video presentation explaining the notebook
7. Review all materials for consistency and accuracy before submission
8. Submit all components by the deadline

Remember to ensure consistency across all three assignments as they should complement each other to form a cohesive educational package on your chosen causality topic.
