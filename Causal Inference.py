        ## Types of Treatment Effects in Causal Inference

        ### What are "Treatments" in Causal Inference?

        In causal inference, a **treatment** refers to the intervention or manipulation being studied to determine its causal effect on an outcome of interest. Despite the medical-sounding terminology, treatments extend far beyond healthcare settings:

        - Medical interventions (medications, surgical procedures)
        - Policy changes (minimum wage increases, educational reforms) 
        - Business decisions (pricing strategies, marketing campaigns)
        - Social interventions (training programs, behavioral modifications)

        The **treatment variable** typically represents whether subjects received the intervention, usually coded as a binary variable (1=received treatment, 0=control/placebo), though it can sometimes be categorical for different treatment types or doses.

        ### Why Calculate Treatment Effects?

        Treatment effects measure the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome. We calculate them to:

        1. **Establish causality, not just correlation**: Determine the independent effect of a treatment when other factors are controlled for
        2. **Understand counterfactuals**: Estimate what would have happened to treated units had they not received treatment (and vice versa)
        3. **Quantify impact**: Measure not just whether an intervention worked, but how well it worked and for whom
        4. **Inform decision-making**: Make better decisions about implementing interventions and targeting specific populations

        ### Key Treatment Effect Measures

        **Average Treatment Effect (ATE):**
        The average effect of the treatment across the entire population.

        \\[ ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)] \\]

        Where Y(1) represents the potential outcome if treated, and Y(0) represents the potential outcome if not treated. This measures the expected difference in outcomes if everyone in the population received treatment versus if no one did.

        **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE):**
        The average effect of the treatment conditional on specific covariates or characteristics.

        \\[ CATE(X=x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X=x] \\]

        This measures how treatment effects vary across different subgroups defined by characteristics X. CATE helps identify which groups benefit most from treatment, enabling more targeted interventions.

        **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT/ATET):**
        The average effect among those who actually received the treatment.

        \\[ ATT = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | T=1] \\]

        This answers: "How much did those who received the treatment actually benefit?" It's particularly useful when evaluating programs that were targeted at specific populations or when treatment assignment wasn't random.

        ### Challenges in Estimation

        A fundamental challenge is that we never observe both potential outcomes for the same unitâ€”known as the "fundamental problem of causal inference". Various methods address this challenge, including:

        - Randomized experiments
        - Regression adjustment
        - Matching methods
        - Instrumental variables
        - Inverse probability weighting
