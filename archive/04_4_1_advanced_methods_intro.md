# Understanding Causal Inference with IHDP: From Theory to Practice - Part 4.4.1

### 4.4 Advanced Machine Learning-Based Methods

> ðŸš€ **Step 4**: Implement advanced machine learning methods for causal inference

Machine learning methods can capture complex relationships between variables without requiring parametric assumptions, potentially leading to more accurate causal estimates.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.base import clone
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Make sure plots look good
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')
sns.set_context("notebook", font_scale=1.2)

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
```

#### Why Use Machine Learning for Causal Inference?

Traditional causal inference methods often rely on parametric assumptions that may not hold in complex, high-dimensional data. Machine learning methods offer several advantages:

1. **Flexibility**: Can capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions
2. **Automation**: Reduce the need for manual model specification
3. **Improved prediction**: Better predictions of potential outcomes
4. **Heterogeneity**: Better at capturing treatment effect heterogeneity

However, machine learning methods also present challenges:

1. **Regularization bias**: Shrinkage can bias treatment effect estimates
2. **Interpretability**: Some methods are "black boxes"
3. **Sample splitting**: May require more data

In this section, we'll implement several advanced machine learning-based methods for causal inference, including meta-learners, doubly robust methods, and causal forests. We'll evaluate their performance on the IHDP dataset and compare them to the simpler methods we've already implemented.
